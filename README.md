# Deep Vision Decoder

This project uses deep learning to classify grayscale images into 26 visually similar categories using CNNs. Once trained, the model is applied to decode a hidden message from a sequence of unlabeled images.

It demonstrates how neural networks can extract subtle visual patterns that are difficult to distinguish with the human eye.
